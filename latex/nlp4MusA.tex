\begin{document}
\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
This document is a supplement to the general instructions for *ACL authors adapted to contain instructions for using the \LaTeX{} style files for NLP4MusA workshops.
The document itself conforms to its own specifications, and is therefore an example of what your manuscript should look like.
These instructions should be used both for papers submitted for review and for final versions of accepted papers. 
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

These instructions are for authors submitting papers to NLP4MusA or accepted for publication in its proceedings.
They are not self-contained. All authors are strongly encouraged to refer to the general instructions for *ACL proceedings.\footnote{\url{http://acl-org.github.io/ACLPUB/formatting.html}}
This document contains additional instructions for the \LaTeX{} style files.

The templates include the \LaTeX{} source of this document (\texttt{nlp4MusA.tex}),
along with the \LaTeX{} style file used to format it (\texttt{nlp4MusA.sty})
an ACL bibliography style (\texttt{nlp4MusA\_natbib.bst}),
an example bibliography (\texttt{nlp4MusA.bib}).
We strongly recommend the use of these style files, which have been appropriately tailored for the NLP4MusA 2024 proceedings.

\section{Submission Instructions}

\subsection{Two-Way Anonymized Review}
The review process is double-blind, so do not include any author information (names, addresses) when submitting a paper for review.  
Even in the review version of the paper, you should maintain space for names and addresses so that they will fit in the final version.

\subsection{Length of Submission}
\label{sec:length}

The NLP4MusA workshop accepts submissions of short papers.
Short papers may consist of up to four (4) pages of content, plus unlimited pages for references.
Upon acceptance, short papers will be given no additional page.
All illustrations and tables that are part of the main text must be accommodated within these page limits, observing the formatting instructions given in the present document. 
Papers that do not conform to the specified length and formatting requirements are subject to be rejected without review.

\subsection{Ethics statement}
We encourage all authors to include an explicit ethics statement on the broader impact of the work, or other ethical considerations after the conclusion but before the references.
The ethics statement will not count toward the page limit.

\subsection{Optional Supplementary Materials: Appendices, Software, and Data}
NLP4MisA does encourage the submission of additional material that is relevant to the reviewers but not an integral part of the paper.
There are two such types of material: appendices, which can be read, and non-readable supplementary materials, often data or code.
Do not include this additional material in the same document as your main paper.
Additional material must be submitted as one or more separate files, and must adhere to the same anonymity guidelines as the main paper.
The paper must be self-contained: it is optional for reviewers to look at the supplementary material.
Papers should not refer, for further detail, to documents, code or data resources that are not available to the reviewers.
Refer to the general instructions for *ACL proceedings\footnote{\url{http://acl-org.github.io/ACLPUB/formatting.html}} for further information. 

\section{Engines}

To produce a PDF file, pdf\LaTeX{} is strongly recommended (over original \LaTeX{} plus dvips+ps2pdf or dvipdf). Xe\LaTeX{} also produces PDF files, and is especially suitable for text in non-Latin scripts.

\section{Preamble}

The first line of the file must be
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass[11pt]{article}
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

To load the style file in the review version:
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
\usepackage[review]{acl}
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
For the final version, omit the \verb|review| option:
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
\usepackage{acl}
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

To use Times Roman, put the following in the preamble:
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
\usepackage{times}
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
(Alternatives like txfonts or newtx are also acceptable.)

Please see the \LaTeX{} source of this document for comments on other packages that may be useful.

Set the title and author using \verb|\title| and \verb|\author|. Within the author list, format multiple authors using \verb|\and| and \verb|\And| and \verb|\AND|; please see the \LaTeX{} source for examples.

By default, the box containing the title and author names is set to the minimum of 5 cm. If you need more space, include the following in the preamble:
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
\setlength\titlebox{<dim>}
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
where \verb|<dim>| is replaced with a length. Do not set this length smaller than 5 cm.

\section{Document Body}

\subsection{Footnotes}

Footnotes are inserted with the \verb|\footnote| command.\footnote{This is a footnote.}

\subsection{Tables and figures}
See Table~\ref{tab:accents} for an example of a table and its caption.
\textbf{Do not override the default caption sizes.}

\begin{table}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{lc}
    \hline
    \textbf{Command} & \textbf{Output} \\
    \hline
    \verb|{\"a}|     & {\"a}           \\
    \verb|{\^e}|     & {\^e}           \\
    \verb|{\`i}|     & {\`i}           \\
    \verb|{\.I}|     & {\.I}           \\
    \verb|{\o}|      & {\o}            \\
    \verb|{\'u}|     & {\'u}           \\
    \verb|{\aa}|     & {\aa}           \\\hline
  \end{tabular}
  \begin{tabular}{lc}
    \hline
    \textbf{Command} & \textbf{Output} \\
    \hline
    \verb|{\c c}|    & {\c c}          \\
    \verb|{\u g}|    & {\u g}          \\
    \verb|{\l}|      & {\l}            \\
    \verb|{\~n}|     & {\~n}           \\
    \verb|{\H o}|    & {\H o}          \\
    \verb|{\v r}|    & {\v r}          \\
    \verb|{\ss}|     & {\ss}           \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Example commands for accented characters, to be used in, \emph{e.g.}, Bib\TeX{} entries.}
  \label{tab:accents}
\end{table}

As much as possible, fonts in figures should conform
to the document fonts. See Figure~\ref{fig:experiments} for an example of a figure and its caption.

Using the \verb|graphicx| package graphics files can be included within figure
environment at an appropriate point within the text.
The \verb|graphicx| package supports various optional arguments to control the
appearance of the figure.
You must include it explicitly in the \LaTeX{} preamble (after the
\verb|\documentclass| declaration and before \verb|\begin{document}|) using
\verb|\usepackage{graphicx}|.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{example-image-golden}
  \caption{A figure with a caption that runs for more than one line.
    Example image is usually available through the \texttt{mwe} package
    without even mentioning it in the preamble.}
  \label{fig:experiments}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure*}[t]
  \includegraphics[width=0.48\linewidth]{example-image-a} \hfill
  \includegraphics[width=0.48\linewidth]{example-image-b}
  \caption {A minimal working example to demonstrate how to place
    two images side-by-side.}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Hyperlinks}

Users of older versions of \LaTeX{} may encounter the following error during compilation:
\begin{quote}
\verb|\pdfendlink| ended up in different nesting level than \verb|\pdfstartlink|.
\end{quote}
This happens when pdf\LaTeX{} is used and a citation splits across a page boundary. The best way to fix this is to upgrade \LaTeX{} to 2018-12-01 or later.

\subsection{Citations}

\begin{table*}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{lll}
    \hline
    \textbf{Output}           & \textbf{natbib command} & \textbf{ACL only command} \\
    \hline
    \citep{Gusfield:97}       & \verb|\citep|           &                           \\
    \citealp{Gusfield:97}     & \verb|\citealp|         &                           \\
    \citet{Gusfield:97}       & \verb|\citet|           &                           \\
    \citeyearpar{Gusfield:97} & \verb|\citeyearpar|     &                           \\
    \citeposs{Gusfield:97}    &                         & \verb|\citeposs|          \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{\label{citation-guide}
    Citation commands supported by the style file.
    The style is based on the natbib package and supports all natbib citation commands.
    It also supports commands defined in previous ACL style files for compatibility.
  }
\end{table*}

Table~\ref{citation-guide} shows the syntax supported by the style files.
We encourage you to use the natbib styles.
You can use the command \verb|\citet| (cite in text) to get ``author (year)'' citations, like this citation to a paper by \citet{Gusfield:97}.
You can use the command \verb|\citep| (cite in parentheses) to get ``(author, year)'' citations \citep{Gusfield:97}.
You can use the command \verb|\citealp| (alternative cite without parentheses) to get ``author, year'' citations, which is useful for using citations within parentheses (e.g. \citealp{Gusfield:97}).

A possessive citation can be made with the command \verb|\citeposs|.
This is not a standard natbib command, so it is generally not compatible
with other style files.

\subsection{References}

\nocite{Ando2005,andrew2007scalable,rasooli-tetrault-2015}

The \LaTeX{} and Bib\TeX{} style files provided roughly follow the American Psychological Association format.
If your own bib file is named \texttt{custom.bib}, then placing the following before any appendices in your \LaTeX{} file will generate the references section for you:
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
\bibliography{custom}
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

Please see Section~\ref{sec:bibtex} for information on preparing Bib\TeX{} files.

\subsection{Equations}

An example equation is shown below:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:example}
  A = \pi r^2
\end{equation}

Labels for equation numbers, sections, subsections, figures and tables
are all defined with the \verb|\label{label}| command and cross references
to them are made with the \verb|\ref{label}| command.

This an example cross-reference to Equation~\ref{eq:example}.

\subsection{Appendices}

Use \verb|\appendix| before any appendix section to switch the section numbering over to letters. See Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix} for an example.

\section{Bib\TeX{} Files}
\label{sec:bibtex}

Unicode cannot be used in Bib\TeX{} entries, and some ways of typing special characters can disrupt Bib\TeX's alphabetization. The recommended way of typing special characters is shown in Table~\ref{tab:accents}.

Please ensure that Bib\TeX{} records contain DOIs or URLs when possible.
Use the \verb|doi| field for DOIs and the \verb|url| field for URLs.
If a Bib\TeX{} entry has a URL or DOI field, the paper title in the references section will appear as a hyperlink to the paper, using the hyperref \LaTeX{} package.
